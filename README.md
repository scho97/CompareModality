## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started

This repository contains all the scripts necessary to reproduce the analysis and figures shown in Chapter 2 of my thesis. It is divided into four main directories:

1. `scripts_data`: Contains the scripts for inspecting subject demographics and data characteristics.
2. `scripts_static`: Contains the scripts for analyzing static power and functional connectivity of resting-state electrophysiological data.
3. `scripts_dynamic`: Contains the scripts for analyzing power and functional connectivity of dynamic resting-state networks.
4. `scripts_reproducibility`: Contains the scripts for examining reproducibility across different dynamic model runs.

### Installation Guide
To start, you first need to install the `osl-dynamics` package and set up its environment. Its installation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl-dynamics).

Next, install the `seaborn` package for visualization, and download this repository to your designated folder location as below. Once these steps are complete, you're ready to go!

```
conda activate osld
pip install seaborn
git clone https://github.com/scho97/CompareModality.git
cd CompareModality
```
