## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started

This repository contains all the scripts necessary to reproduce the analysis and figures shown in Chapter 2 of my thesis. It is divided into four main directories:

1. `scripts_data`: Contains the scripts for inspecting subject demographics and data characteristics.
2. `scripts_static`: Contains the scripts for analyzing static power and functional connectivity of resting-state electrophysiological data.
3. `scripts_dynamic`: Contains the scripts for analyzing power and functional connectivity of dynamic resting-state networks.
4. `scripts_reproducibility`: Contains the scripts for examining reproducibility across different dynamic model runs.

### Installation Guide
To start, you first need to install the `osl-dynamics` package and set up its environment. Its installation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl-dynamics).

The `seaborn` and `openpyxl` packages need to be additionally installed for visualization and compatibility with excel files. Next, download this repository to your designated folder location as below. Once these steps are complete, you're ready to go!

```
conda activate osld
pip install seaborn
pip install openpyxl
git clone https://github.com/scho97/CompareModality.git
cd CompareModality
```
